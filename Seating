Input format:
Input consists of 3 integers and a string
The first input denotes the seating capacity of L1(a)
The second input denotes the seating capacity of L2(b)
The third input denotes the seating capacity of L3(c)
The fourth input denotes the lab which is allocated for ACE training
Output format:

Refer the Sample output for formatting
Sample Input:
30
40
20
L3
Sample Output:
L1
program:

# Input: Seating capacities and the allocated lab
capacity_L1 = int(input())
capacity_L2 = int(input())
capacity_L3 = int(input())
allocated_lab = input().strip()

# Dictionary to hold lab capacities
capacities = {
    'L1': capacity_L1,
    'L2': capacity_L2,
    'L3': capacity_L3
}

# Remove the allocated lab from the dictionary
if allocated_lab in capacities:
    del capacities[allocated_lab]

# Find the lab with minimal seating capacity
min_lab = min(capacities, key=capacities.get)

# Output: Lab with minimal seating capacity
print(min_lab)
